# Contribution guidelines

## Commit messages

The Git commit messages should follow the [Conventional Commits guideslines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

There are no automatic validations of those guidelines in place, but you may get asked to split up a pull request which contains changes of different types.
